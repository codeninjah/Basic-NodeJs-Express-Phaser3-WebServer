# Basic-NodeJs-Express-Phaser3-WebServer

## What's Phaser?
Phaser is a JavaScript framework that allows you to create and run 2D games. Read more here: https://phaser.io/

## Why a web server for it?
In order for you to be able to run your games, you'll need a web server. There is XAMPP, WAMP and a couple of others but I've built one just for fun.

## How to run it
```
git clone repo
npm install
node app.js
Navigate at localhost:8000
```


What you'll need is also to replace the html file in te views folder with your own. Also in /public/assets, you'll need to place your own. Enjoy!
