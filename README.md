# Basic-NodeJs-Express-Phaser3-WebServer

## What's Phaser?
Phaser is a JavaScript framework that allows you to create and run 2D games. Read more here: https://phaser.io/

## Why a web server for it?
In order for you to be able to run your games, you'll need a web server. There is XAMPP, WAMP and a couple of others but I've built this one just for fun.

## How to run it
```
git clone repo
npm install
change line 2 in app.js or app2.js with the name of the .html file you want to run
the html file must be placed in the views folder
node app.js (or app2.js)
Navigate at localhost:8000
```


Also in /public/assets, you'll need to place your own. 
I'm going to keep update this repo with different projects for learning how to work with Phaser. Enjoy!
